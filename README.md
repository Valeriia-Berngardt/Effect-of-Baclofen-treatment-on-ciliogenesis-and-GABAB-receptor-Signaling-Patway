# Research Methods Course

## Introduction

*Nematostella vectensis* is a well-known model organism that combines a simple life cycle with well-established genomic resources, making it an excellent model for studying ciliogenesis. By the third day after fertilization, planulae are actively swimming, as their entire body is covered with primary cilia. Cilia are essential organelles in animals, specialized for cell signaling, fluid flow, and cell movement. Dysfunction in cilia can lead to severe human diseases known as ciliopathies.

## Background

### GABAB-Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling Pathway

The GABAB-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway plays a crucial role during neurogenesis in mammals. However, there are limited studies on its role in *Nematostella vectensis*. Previous research in our lab, using the human GABAB-receptor agonist drug baclofen, demonstrated that *Nematostella* planula neurogenesis, ciliogenesis, and metamorphosis were reversibly arrested. Additionally, our lab discovered that the GABAB-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway is associated with cilia aberrations.

## Study Aim

The primary aim of my study is to investigate the effect of baclofen on the process of ciliogenesis in planulae of *Nematostella vectensis*. Specifically, I aim to understand how baclofen affects secondary ciliogenesis after the removal of cilia.

## Research Design

### Control Groups

The first stage of the work will involve analyzing the movements of two control groups:
- **Group 1:** Planulae control group
- **Group 2:** Planulae treated with baclofen

### Methodology

To elucidate the changes in proteins synthesized by the planulae during secondary ciliogenesis, I will apply the Western Blot method. This technique will allow me to detect and quantify specific proteins involved in ciliogenesis.

## Significance of the Study

This study has the potential to open new avenues for comparative studies of cilia function and evolution. In particular, it may contribute to our understanding of cilia pathophysiology and the role of the GABAB signaling pathway in ciliopathies. By exploring these mechanisms in *Nematostella vectensis*, we may gain insights that are relevant to human health, particularly in the context of ciliopathies.
