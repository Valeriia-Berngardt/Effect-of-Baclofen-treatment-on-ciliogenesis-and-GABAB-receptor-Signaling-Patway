## Importance of the Study

The study of GABAB receptors and ciliogenesis in *Nematostella vectensis* is crucial not only for understanding basic biological processes but also for its potential medical applications. Cilia are small organelles that play essential roles in cell movement, signal transmission, and fluid flow regulation. When their function is disrupted, it can lead to severe diseases in humans, such as polycystic kidney disease, vision problems, and congenital heart defects.

*Nematostella vectensis* is a unique organism that, despite its simplicity, shares many biological processes with more complex animals, including humans. By studying how baclofen affects cilia formation in *Nematostella*, we can gain better insights into how these processes function in other species, including humans.

## Potential Medical Impact

If we can identify key elements in the GABAB signaling pathway that regulate ciliogenesis, it may lead to the development of new treatments for diseases associated with cilium dysfunction. Thus, our study may have significant implications not only for science but also for the development of new therapeutic approaches for various human diseases.

## Working Hypothesis

Previous studies have demonstrated that baclofen reduces the motility of *Nematostella* planulae and that the GABAB receptor signaling pathway is associated with impaired cilia development. **I hypothesize that baclofen affects neurotransmission in planulae, specifically impacting secondary ciliogenesis through GABAB receptor interactions.** The active movement of planulae after the removal of cilia and the addition of baclofen may be a natural response to changes in environmental chemistry.

## Expected Significance

Understanding the role of GABAB receptors in ciliogenesis could be instrumental in treating ciliopathies. The insights gained from this study may contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies targeting GABAB receptors, potentially leading to new treatments for diseases caused by ciliary dysfunction.
